      <h1>About Fireman</h1>
      <p>
        Fireman is an online archive designed to help students of the Department of Accounting &amp; Information Systems at the University of Barishal easily access past exam papers in one place. Whether you’re preparing for midterms or finals, this platform is here to make your study process smoother and more organized.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why Fireman Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Reviewing past questions is one of the smartest ways to prepare for exams. Fireman gathers question papers from different semesters and batches—typed, cleaned, and arranged by course. The aim is to reduce exam stress and support focused, effective preparation.
      </p>
      
      <h2>How It’s Built</h2>
      <p>
        Fireman is a student-led project, initiated and managed by Tanvir Mahfuz, Class Representative, with contributions from fellow students. Here’s how it works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Digitization:</strong> Papers are typed or OCR-scanned from original copies.</li>
        <li><strong>Editing:</strong> Each paper is carefully reviewed and corrected for clarity and accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Final versions are uploaded and organized by semester and course.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Part of “Learn with Tanvir”</h2>
      <p>
        Fireman is part of the Learn with Tanvir initiative. What started as a simple WhatsApp group for sharing academic resources has grown into a full-fledged platform focused on structured, accessible educational support.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        Fireman is strictly for academic use. Solutions to questions will be added over time. New papers are uploaded regularly after each semester. The platform is continuously growing to better serve students’ academic needs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We hope Fireman becomes a reliable companion in your academic journey. Thank you for being with us.
