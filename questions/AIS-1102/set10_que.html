<p>1. You are the manager of a coffeehouse called The Morning Cup. One of your best employees desires to be promoted to a managerial position; however, the owner is grooming his slow-thinking son for the job. The owner’s nepotism may hurt a valuable employee’s chances for advancement, but complaining may hurt your own chances of promotion. What do you do?</p>

<p>2. With more than 3,500 locations, Sonic is the largest chain of food restaurants in the United States. Unlike other chains, many Sonic locations are individually owned and operated. Sonic has maintained its go-getter attitude thanks to the leadership of founder Troy Smith. After returning from World War II, Smith realized he wanted to run a business of his own. Over the next few months, he established several restaurants in his hometown of Shawnee, Oklahoma—ranging from his own fried chicken chain to experimenting with different concepts. Running these businesses as sole proprietorships allowed him to make all the major decisions, though he struggled initially. Eventually, Smith purchased a rundown parking lot with an old cabin and planned to turn it into a restaurant. He tore down a soft drinks stand to make room for more parking and named the business Top Hat Drive-In. Over time, he discovered that the soft drinks stand was generating better business than the restaurant itself. Capitalizing on this, he started serving burgers and hired servers to attend to customers. Revenue at Top Hat Drive-In soon tripled. Later, when local entrepreneur Frank Henry approached him about investing, the two formed a partnership—Henry focusing on operations while Smith improved the business. However, they later discovered that the Top Hat name was already trademarked, and despite their limited partnership protecting personal assets, they were sued over the name. To resolve the issue, they changed the business name to Sonic Drive-In. Business boomed, and with growing interest from others, Smith decided to expand by franchising rather than taking on more partners. This model allowed entrepreneurs to open their own Sonic locations with support from the corporate office. Today, Sonic has thousands of franchisees operating nationwide. The flexible ownership system enables franchisees to focus on building their business rather than managing the brand.</p>
