    <li>Answer any four questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> Read the passage below and answer the questions:</p>
  <p>Many industries see Europe as the land of opportunity, with its strong economic growth and steady deregulation as the European Community becomes a single market. With the fall of communism and the opening of Eastern Europe, as Europeans’ income rise and they discover the joy of spending, firms will see numerous opportunities to sell their wares to eager new customers. Deregulation of radio and television will create demand for new programs, advertising, and privately owned networks. The construction industry will boom, with billions spent to develop roads, telecommunications systems, and modern cities.</p>
  <p>U.S. companies do not want to miss their chance in Europe. Through exporting, joint ventures, acquisitions, and the opening of manufacturing plants, American firms are investing heavily in Europe. For example, Intel Corporation has built its first plant in Europe, a $400 million computer facility in Ireland. Motorola expanded its operations in Europe by selecting Scotland as an export base for the rest of the European community. Pfizer bought Medinvent, a manufacturer of medical equipment in Switzerland.</p>
  <p>U.S. firms face competition for the prime European markets. Japan’s business interest in Europe is small but growing. Japanese automakers are challenging the European franchises of Ford and GM. Japan is also the major supplier of components to Europe’s largest computer manufacturer. U.S. firms believe they must take quick action in Europe or lose to Japanese companies.</p>
  <p>Germany seems to be the most promising country, with expected growth averaging 4 percent from 1990 to 1995. The flow of immigrants from east to west in Germany is increasing demand for consumer goods. Additionally, a huge construction effort is increasing sales of everything from housing to transportation. Czechoslovakia offers excellent business prospects with 32 million relatively affluent consumers. The least promising countries are Romania, where chaos and bloodshed still loom, and Yugoslavia, where reforms are slow.</p>
  <p>Business firms are finding Europe receptive to foreign investors. For instance, Italy paid half of the $1.2 billion that Texas Instruments spent to build a calculator and semiconductor plant there. Scotland and Ireland compete vigorously for foreign investors by providing tax incentives, help with training, facilities, and capital. However, U.S. firms believe they may encounter some resistance in Europe if they invest too rapidly.</p>

  <p><strong>Questions for Discussion:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>(a) Why does Europe offer opportunities for new business firms?</li>
    <li>(b) What are some of the approaches firms have used to become involved in the European market?</li>
    <li>(c) What barriers will firms face when investing in Europe?</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3.</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>(a) Define a merger. Discuss the different kinds of mergers.</li>
    <li>(b) Discuss the benefits and consequences of a merger.</li>
    <li>(c) Give examples of some merger efforts in Bangladesh and in the world.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>4.</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>(a) Explain the relationship between business ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR).</li>
    <li>(b) What is unethical behavior? Discuss with examples. Identify the roots of unethical behavior.</li>
    <li>(c) What are the ways of advancing CSR?</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>5.</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>(a) What is marketing and the marketing concept? Explain the P’s in marketing.</li>
    <li>(b) What do you mean by Finance? Explain briefly the different sources of long-term financing.</li>
    <li>(c) Identify the core skills that managers need to acquire and practice.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>6.</strong> Write short notes (any five):</p>

        <li>With more than 3,500 locations, Sonic is the largest chain of food restaurants in the United States. Unlike other chains, many Sonic locations are individually owned and operated. Sonic has maintained its go-getter attitude thanks to the leadership of founder Troy Smith. After returning from World War II, Smith realized he wanted to run a business of his own. Over the next few months, he established several restaurants in his hometown of Shawnee, Oklahoma—ranging from his own fried chicken chain to experimenting with different concepts. Running these businesses as sole proprietorships allowed him to make all the major decisions, though he struggled initially. Eventually, Smith purchased a rundown parking lot with an old cabin and planned to turn it into a restaurant. He tore down a soft drinks stand to make room for more parking and named the business Top Hat Drive-In. Over time, he discovered that the soft drinks stand was generating better business than the restaurant itself. Capitalizing on this, he started serving burgers and hired servers to attend to customers. Revenue at Top Hat Drive-In soon tripled. Later, when local entrepreneur Frank Henry approached him about investing, the two formed a partnership—Henry focusing on operations while Smith improved the business. However, they later discovered that the Top Hat name was already trademarked, and despite their limited partnership protecting personal assets, they were sued over the name. To resolve the issue, they changed the business name to Sonic Drive-In. Business boomed, and with growing interest from others, Smith decided to expand by franchising rather than taking on more partners. This model allowed entrepreneurs to open their own Sonic locations with support from the corporate office. Today, Sonic has thousands of franchisees operating nationwide. The flexible ownership system enables franchisees to focus on building their business rather than managing the brand.</li>

      <li>Thinking It Over:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>i) Like many entrepreneurs, Troy Smith started Sonic as a sole proprietorship, then took on a partner, and eventually offered franchises. What advantages did he enjoy at each stage of Sonic’s development? What disadvantages did he face?</li>
        <li>ii) How is a franchise different from a partnership?</li>
        <li>iii) What important questions should you ask before becoming a franchisee in a company like Sonic?</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>5.</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>a) Differentiate between vertical and horizontal combination.</li>
      <li>b) Differentiate between ethics and business ethics.</li>
      <li>c) “Good business ethics promotes good business.” Explain the significance of business ethics in a 21st-century scenario.</li>
      <li>d) What is meant by an economic system?</li>
      <li>e) Narrate the types of economic systems. Which economic system is best? Explain.</li>
      <li>f) Write the significance of a Letter of Credit (L/C) in international business.</li>

  <p><strong>6.</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>a) Review Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and determine where you currently stand on the hierarchy. What needs of yours are not being met? How could a company meet those needs and thereby motivate you to work more effectively?</li>
      <li>b) Herzberg concluded that pay was not a motivator. If you were paid to get better grades, would you be less motivated to study harder? In your employment experiences, have you ever worked harder to obtain a raise or as a result of receiving a large raise? Do you agree with Herzberg about the effects of pay?</li>
      <li>c) Compare the business-to-business market and the consumer market.</li>
      <li>d) Describe the four P’s of marketing.</li>
