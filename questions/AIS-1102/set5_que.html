<p>2. Read the passage below and answer the questions:</p>
<p><em>Passage:</em></p>
<p>Many industries see Europe as the land of opportunity, with its strong economic growth and steady deregulation as the European Community becomes a single market. With the fall of communism and the opening of Eastern Europe, as Europeans’ incomes rise and they discover the joy of spending, firms will see numerous opportunities to sell their wares to eager new customers. Deregulation of radio and television will create demand for new programs, advertising, and privately owned networks. The construction industry will boom, with billions spent to develop roads, telecommunications systems, and modern cities.</p>
<p>U.S. companies do not want to miss their chance in Europe. Through exporting, joint ventures, acquisitions, and the opening of manufacturing plants, American firms are investing heavily in Europe. For example, Intel Corporation has built its first plant in Europe—a $400 million computer facility in Ireland. Motorola expanded its operations in Europe by selecting Scotland as an export base for the rest of the European Community. Pfizer bought Medinvent, a manufacturer of medical equipment in Switzerland.</p>
<p>U.S. firms face competition for the prime European markets. Japan’s business interest in Europe is small but growing. Japanese automakers are challenging the European franchises of Ford and GM. Japan is also the major supplier of components to Europe’s largest computer manufacturer. U.S. firms believe they must take quick action in Europe or lose to Japanese companies.</p>
<p>Germany seems to be the most promising country, with expected growth averaging 4 percent from 1990 to 1995. The flow of immigrants from east to west in Germany is increasing demand for consumer goods. Additionally, a huge construction effort is increasing sales of everything from housing to transportation. Czechoslovakia offers excellent business prospects with 32 million relatively affluent consumers. The least promising countries are Romania, where chaos and bloodshed still loom, and Yugoslavia, where reforms are slow.</p>
<p>Business firms are finding Europe receptive to foreign investors. For instance, Italy paid half of the $1.2 billion that Texas Instruments spent to build a calculator and semiconductor plant there. Scotland and Ireland compete vigorously for foreign investors by providing tax incentives, help with training, facilities, and capital. However, U.S. firms believe they may encounter some resistance in Europe if they invest too rapidly.</p>
